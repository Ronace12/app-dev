## Famous quotes from the Movie Series

### Aslan's quote about the four children
"To the glistening eastern sea, I give you Queen Lucy the Valiant. To the great western wood, King Edmund the Just. To the radiant southern sun, Queen Susan the Gentle. And to the clear northern sky, I give you King Peter the Magnificent".

"Here on the mountain, the air is clear and your mind is clear; as you drop down into Narnia, the air will thicken. Take great care that it does not confuse your mind".

### Creator of Narnia
Aslan created Narnia, called forth the landforms and heavenly bodies, and gave some animals the ability to speak. 

### Appearance

### Role in the end of Narnia
In the last days of Narnia, Aslan plays a role similar to what the Bible says Jesus will do when the world ends. 

### C.S. Lewis uses Christian symbolism and themes throughout The Chronicles of Narnia. Other examples include:
The four Pevensie children represent the four apostles of Jesus.
Edmund represents Judas, or the fallen-man figure.
Susan and Lucy represent Mary Magdalene and Mary the Mother of James.
